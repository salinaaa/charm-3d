sponsored by the
<a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de">Hausdorff Center for Mathematics</a>
at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>, Germany.

<h2>Graphics output and mesh load and save</h2>
<p class="book">
This tutorial is about file system I/O.
The first topic is writing specially formatted text files in the
<a href="https://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf">VTK format</a>
for interactive visualization.
The second topic is about writing the current state of the mesh to disk,
and about reading it back in, with the same or a different number of MPI ranks.
To this end, we use the MPI I/O interface standard.

<dt>Skills acquired</dt><dd>
You will have written cell- and corner-based numerical data to graphics files
and looked at them in third-party visualization software.
We also cover saving and loading the <tt>p4est</tt> mesh in a parallel
partition-independent format, which is great for flexible checkpointing
and overall reproducibility.
</dd>
<dt>Next steps</dt><dd>
Extend your hello-world program by adding a nonlinear, smooth geometry
transformation that is passed to the VTK output routine.
Extend the VTK output routine to write one big MPI file in the binary appended
VTK format (instead of many VTU files and one PVTU file as we do currently).

<h3>VTK graphics output</h3>
<p class="book">
We are creating and manipulating meshes, which are complex objects embedded in
2- or 3-dimensional space, and want to look at them.
To this end, <tt>p4est</tt> provides the files <code>p{4,8}est_vtk.{c,h}</code>
with routines that write files to disk in the VTK graphics format.
The easiest call is
</p>
<pre class="book">
p4est_vtk_write_file (p4est, NULL, "filename");
</pre>
<p class="cont">
We take a valid <tt>p4est</tt> object, query its communicator for metadata,
and write the local quadrants using a filename that is postfixed with
<code>_rank.vtu</code>, where the rank is zero-padded to four digits.
For each quadrant, we write its MPI rank, tree number and level.
These are available as input fields within the visualization program.
The <code>NULL</code> argument indicates to use the vertex coordinates from
the connectivity.
You may alternatively specify a <tt>p4est_geometry</tt> object to provide
your own coordinate map.
</p>
<p class="book">
While the call is not strictly MPI-collective, the output is only complete
if every process calls it with the same filename.
Rank zero in addition writes a meta file ending in <code>.pvtu</code>
that contains a directory of all <code>.vtu</code> files written.
You may now use a visualization program to read these files and display them.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise I1:
to visualize a connectivity structure, <a
href="tutorial-forest.html#create">create a minimal <tt>p4est</tt></a>
at level zero and visualize that.
Experiment with varying MPI sizes and play with the <code>wrap_rank</code>
parameter.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise I2:
Add some calls to <code>p4est_vtk_write_file</code>
to your favorite example program, using a different file name on each occasion,
and examine the results.
Verify the tree number, MPI rank, and quadrant level interactively.
</p>
<p class="book">
A more powerful interface to writing VTK files works as follows:
Create an opaque <tt>p4est</tt> VTK context, set parameters to the context,
write the file header, zero or more data arrays, and the file footer.
Writing the footer automatically deallocates the context and closes all files.
Please see the inline documentation in the <tt>p4est_vtk</tt> header file for
the prototypes.
</p>
<p class="book">
This interface allows to add custom data to the output.
The data may be provided per corner or per cell (quadrant).
Writing per corner requires a consistent corner numbering,
which will be discussed in a later tutorial.
The number of local quadrants, on the other hand, is easily available from the
<tt>p4est</tt> object, and the input data array must match in length.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise I3:
Create an <code>sc_array</code> (see the files
<code>sc/src/sc_containers.{c,h}</code> for details) of correct length.
Populate some per-quadrant data: Write a loop over the process-local trees,
a nested loop over the tree-local quadrants, access each quadrant and define the
data written for it as some function of its coordinates, level,
tree or sequence number or anything else.
Look at the visualization to make sure everything is right.
Don't forget to deallocate the array after writing.

<h3>Partition-independent file I/O</h3>
<p class="book">
The <tt>p4est</tt> object stores the topology of the parallel adapted mesh
and optionally some fixed amount of data per quadrant, the size of which is
specified with <code>p4est_new</code> or <code>p4est_copy</code>.
This data is preserved on repartitioning.
It is also visible to the replace callbacks in <code>p4est_refine_ext</code>,
<code>p4est_coarsen_ext</code> and <code>p4est_balance_ext</code>,
which allows the user to process it appropriately on any local mesh change.
It is convenient and generally not harmful to use this data for numerical state,
however, for anything more than a couple variables we recommend to store
numerical data in application memory.
In that case, use your own interpolation/projection logic on adaptation and the
<code>p4est_transfer</code> functions on repartition.
</p>
<p class="book">
Both the mesh and the quadrant-local data can be written to one large MPI file
using the collective call
</p>
<pre class="book">
p4est_save_ext ("filename", p4est, save_data, save_partition);
</pre>
<p class="cont">
The boolean parameter <code>save_data</code> enables or disables storing
per-quadrant data in the file.
The boolean parameter <code>save_partition</code> enables or disables storing
the exact partition.  If we do not store the partition, the code on loading will
equi-partition the quadrants in the file among the processes used for reading.
This is fast; there is no need to worry about partitioning in <tt>p4est</tt>.
It will then not be possible to recreate the parallel ownership of each
quadrant prior to saving, but then such is rarely required.
If, on the other hand, the partition is saved, the header of the file is
prepended with this information.  The volume of this information is small,
but there is the caveat that the file size written, for the same global mesh,
will differ between different MPI sizes.
Such is not acceptable for strictly partition-independent storage.
</p>
<p class="book">
On loading the mesh, you may use the call
</p>
<pre class="book">
p4est = p4est_load_ext ("filename", mpicomm, data_size, load_data,
                        autopartition, 1, NULL, NULL);
</pre>
<p class="cont">
This function allocates a new <tt>p4est</tt> object and reads it from disk.
If loading data is enabled, the data size provided must be equal to the
data size in the file.  If loading data is false, the new <tt>p4est</tt> object
will have zero data size.
If autopartition is true, we discard any saved partition and read the
quadrants from the file equi-partitioned.
If it is false, the call will crash if no saved partition is present.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise I4:
Write a function <code>p4est_can_load</code> that determines without crashing
whether the file on disk exists and will be acceptable to load for a given set
of parameters.
Such a function shall only read the header on rank zero and broadcast the
result to all other processes.
It may optionally populate a structure passed by reference with some statistics
and information from the file.
</p>
<p class="exer">
Exercise I5:
Extend your favorite program example to save and load a <tt>p4est</tt>.
Create a partition-independent mesh refinement and write the same mesh
using different MPI sizes (and file names).  Check under which conditions the
files are identical, and if this matches with the documentation.  Verify that
the function indeed crashes if used out of specification.
